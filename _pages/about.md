I am a PhD student at the *Chair for Data Science in the Economic and Social Sciences* at the University of Mannheim. Our chair focuses on developing methods for understanding human social and economic behavior via analyzing textual and relational data.

My academic background bridges two distinct but complementary fields, with a B.A. in Sociology from Otto-Friedrich University Bamberg and an M.Sc. in Data Science from the University of Mannheim. This combination drives my research in Computational Social Science, where I focus on the deployment and evaluation of Large Language Models. Specifically, I am interested in two key areas: leveraging and evaluating LLMs for synthetic data generation to model society, and advancing knowledge in survey methodology. I pursue computational, empirical and data-driven research approaches in collaboration with colleagues from the computer sciences, the economic sciences and the social sciences.
